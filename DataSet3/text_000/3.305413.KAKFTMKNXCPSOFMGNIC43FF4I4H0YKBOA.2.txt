A heat wave is expected to hit California in the coming week,prompting worried state officials to search for ways to reduce demand for electricity

California suffered three days of strained power supplies last week,when warm weather pushed demand higher Utilities asked businesses to cut power,a worrisome sign that a widespread blackout might hit the state sometime this year

At an emergency meeting Thursday,the California Independent System Operator,an agency that manages most of the electricity in the state,considered steps to keep energy prices in check,including putting a second price cap in two weeks on wholesale electricity

The scramble for electricity is exacerbated by a growing population,a thriving economy and an uneasy transition to an open market

The agency is struggling to protect consumers while still giving the companies that sell electricity an incentive to sell in California Electricity bills have risen nearly 60 percent since May for thousands of consumers in San Diego and south Orange counties,where San Diego Gas&Electric Co,which serves that area,passed on higher electricity costs to residents and businesses

The state's other large utilities-Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric-cannot raise electricity prices for residential and small-business customers because their rates are frozen

The California ISO is considering lowering the price cap on electricity from 500 per megawatt hour to 250 per megawatt hour That comes a week after the board reduced a 750 cap to 500 and decided to investigate rising costs

The agency is worried,however,that the cap could discourage power-plant developers from building new generators in California It also could motivate generators to sell power in other Western states where caps don't exist and prices are higher

Here's what you need to know about the electricity supply and how it affects Orange County consumers

Q How did this start

A Demand has surged because about 600,000 new residents enter the state every year,but no power plants have been built in a decade

Most of the growth has occurred inland,where temperatures rise dramatically in the summer and residents rely heavily on air conditioning

The addition of new jobs,particularly in technology and manufacturing,also requires more electricity Computers are using a bigger chunk of the power supply,gobbling up an estimated 13 percent of available power sources last year,up from just 1 percent in 1983

Q How do price caps affect me

A If you're a residential or small-business customer of Southern California Edison,it won't affect you at all Customers of that utility are protected by a rate cap imposed as part of deregulation Rates were frozen at artificially high levels to allow utilities to collect money to pay debt and recoup lost revenue for unprofitable assets,such as nuclear power plants The cap stays until 2002 or until the utility pays off these stranded costs

San Diego Gas&Electric,which serves 100,000 customers in Dana Point,San Juan Capistrano,San Clemente and parts of Laguna Beach,Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo,paid off its stranded costs in June 1999

Q If I buy my electricity from San Diego Gas&Electric,how much more will I pay

A Higher market rates mean the average SDG&E residential customer now will pay 87.50 per month,or 10.7 cents per kilowatt,vs 55,or 3.3 cents per kilowatt,in May

Customers pay an amount that blends the higher rates charged on peak days with the lower fees charged when the weather cools and electricity is less in demand

Q What efforts can consumers take to reduce electricity

A Blackouts typically occur early in the week,often on a Monday That's because businesses are turning on air conditioners,often after peak usage on a hot summer weekend

Consumers should avoid using dryers or washing machines from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.-peak hours for energy use

Turning air conditioners off when leaving the house,using fans and setting thermostats a few degrees higher,to 78 or 80 degrees,will help save energy

Residents should draw blinds and drapes during the day to keep out the sun If possible,try to reduce trips to the refrigerator and freezer
