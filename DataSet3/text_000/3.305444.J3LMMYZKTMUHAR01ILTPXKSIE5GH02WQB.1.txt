What About the California Wholesale Market Really Needs Fixing?

August 24, 2000

2
Summary
High prices in peak periods are the result of scarcity and are necessary to incent needed generation investment
California Retail/Wholesale Market Interaction
Retail customers are benefiting from the low prices during shoulder months caused by wholesale competition
The major problem is in the retail market where high peak period wholesale prices have not been mitigated by forward purchases 
Underscheduling in forward market causes high demand and reliability problems during real time

3
Summary (Continued) 
Some wholesale market  remedies are necessary now
The FERC should analyze whether there are Market Power Concerns Associated with Times of Scarcity and then determine appropriate level of Price Caps
Publicize Market Information 
Encourage structure/ technological innovation to enhance  demand side participation

Western Supply and Demand Fundamentals

6
Western Supply and Demand Indicates Scarcity
California competes vigorously with the rest of the growing west for increasingly scarce supplies
Load growth fueled by strong economy 
No significant new generation in California since the 1980s
Market was fooled by excellent hydro years
The existing thermal generation fleet is aging: 61% > 30 years 
The complete lack of available NOx credits may have prevented generators from running

7
California Competes with the Rest of the West for Scarce Supplies






Ample long distance transmission
Traditional Northwest players’ best opportunities often outside of the NW
Powerex Accesses Alberta Pool, Northwest, California
BPA often prices daily offer at PX Index price
Spread between COB and Northern California close to $0/MWh
Turbine market is national --> Northwest and California must compete with all of North America for new resources

Current Supply/Demand Economics

FERC Regulatory Overlay
Allowed Cal ISO to set “bid” caps
Price reduced from $250 to $750 on 10/1/99
Reduced from $750 to $500 on 6/29/00
Reduced from $500 to $250 on 8/7/00
Cal PX - recently reduced from $2500 implicit cap to $350 explicit cap

21
Price Controls Will Perpetuate Scarcity 
Power plants are needed; Demand is still not very price responsive 
Operating costs of plants are increasing 
Gas prices high
Gas generally is on the Margin in WSCC (I.e., Gas-fired generation sets the electricity generating market price)
Power plant economics will keep generators from investing in generation if they anticipate price cap
In state and out of state generation will be incented to sell out of state

Power Plant Economics
Investors will not invest in power plants if they can only earn short term marginal cost (I.e., the cost of fuel and operation and maintenance without earning a return on their investments)
The $250 price cap may not provide a return on investment

Load Responsiveness
2700 MW of Load theoretically available under the Interruptible Tariffs
New Load Management Programs Have Been Expensive and Small
100 MW to 300 MW of Shared Savings with IOU’s When Prices Exceed $250/MWh
230 MW in CAISO Participating Load Agreement with Capacity Costs of $750/MWh and Energy Costs Up to $750/MWh
Seldom Used - Most Participants Already Under Interruptible Tariff

32
The ISO’s Demand Side Program Has Not Been Very Effective   
The proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is "workably competitive" then there is no need for price caps
But if ISO sets the caps too low it will not get demand response
The utilities have up to 2700 MW of available interruptible load, yet only a small fraction responds when called (600 MW)
Uncut loads willingly lose value of up to $1,500 per MWh  
Thus, during times of scarcity, the value of energy is at least $1,500 per MWh

33
Price Controls are Detrimental to Investment and Other Markets
Merchant generation subject to volatile commodity prices -- caps will inhibit investment
Creates asymmetry between load response and generation
Suppliers will sell outside California where markets are more predictable and prices are higher.
Because of the interdependent linkages in California’s electric market, cannot change one aspect of structure without impacting all others
Uncertainty in the marketplace will dry up the growing forward markets

Are Retail Prices High and Do They Indicate Wholesale Market Failures?
DMA admits that there is workable competition for 98-99% of the total annual hours
It assumes that market power is present when bids exceed only short run marginal cost rather than considering long term returns, or other market power indices.

Overall, even with scarcity conditions, retail prices have not been significantly increased due to wholesale competition in California (for SDG&E 10-20 percent annual increase, possible 10-20% overall decrease when adjusted for SDG&E rebate)
Is it appropriate to institute wholesale price controls to mitigate retail price risk? 
Wholesale futures prices are behaving rationally regardless of these short term retail prices
Do these Prices Warrant Wholesale Market Intervention?

Lack of IOU Hedging Has Distorted Price Impacts 
The IOUs had a choice of buying their power in the PX Block Forward, PX Day Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post
Hedging limits prevented some purchases of forward energy 
IOU claims notwithstanding, there have been significant opportunities to hedge forward prices
~ 1800 MW in entire PX block forward for SP15 in June, 2000
Only ~800 MW for SCE out of  2,200 MW authorized 
Clear market signals to hedge
Fear of prudence review kept IOUs from hedging the risk of day ahead and real time prices

Stranded Cost Recovery Incents IOUs to Underschedule in the Forward Market and Buy in the Spot Market
CTC payments can theoretically be increased by underscheduling demand in the PX Day ahead markets
But, underscheduling demand increases ISO prices and reduces reliability
~ 30% of ISO load in real time market on 06/14/00
Only 100 MW of blackouts--a remarkable achievement

53
Gross Underscheduling of Load Is a Real Problem

Wholesale Market Remedies Necessary Now
Analyze whether there are market power concerns associated with times of scarcity and then determine appropriate level of  price caps
Publicize market information 
Encourage structure/ technological innovation to enhance  demand side participation
Don’t mistake San Diego’s failure to hedge as failures in the wholesale market
Decide whether FERC has a role in the underscheduling issue: Are the California utilities exercising monopsony power by underscheduling load into the PX day ahead market? 

60
ISO Should Do More Rigorous Market Power Analysis
The Market Analysis Unit report and the UC Energy Institute Report wrongly uses pricing above short term marginal cost to conclude that there is market power  
Some market power analysis failed to take into consideration changes in supply and demand like the decrease in hydro generation
To distinguish market power from scarcity, FERC should instruct the ISO to use rigorous analytical measures to determine market power
Under such measures Enron does not have market power

ISO Should Allow Scarcity Rents
At points of scarcity (e.g., at Stage 2 when you’re getting low on reserves and you’re cutting load) marginal cost is no longer a reasonable price. 
Rather when you reach scarcity you should price scarcity rents at the value of energy (e.g., $1,500 as illustrated in the interruptible market)

62
To Investigate the Source of High Prices FERC Should Review:
High gas prices
Below normal Hydro
Lack of NOx credits
High demand
How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during the Summer 2000 compared with  1999?
Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities in 2000?  
Were  baseload facilities operated differently in 2000 than in 1999?

63
To Investigate the Source of High Prices FERC Should Review (Continued)
Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during Summer 2000? 
Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
What options did SDG&E have to "hedge" its retail rates?  
What were prices in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
FERC and the  ISO should consider the regional impacts of any price caps implemented in California, such as prices not corresponding to flows

64
Other Market Growing Pains
Only a limited number of out-of state participants can access spin and non-spin markets
Rate freeze prevents consumers from receiving price signals (I.e., some amount of load increase is illogical behavior) 
Intrazonal congestion not explicitly priced--Socialized across all loads
Complex computer model used to price transmission
Relatively little transmission available in forward markets
Stakeholder board subject to political pressure
Forward market liquidity has evaporated due to price cap changes

65
We Do Not Have All the Answers.  Why?
Much information that is necessary to analyze the California PX and ISO markets is not available to markets participants  
We believe that California can significantly enhance competition in its electricity markets if this information is made available

66
Why Would Information Make the Market More Competitive?
Publishing price information would provide better price signals producing a more efficient market
Publishing generation and load information would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators with a large percentage of the market 
Publishing transmission information would remove the ATC knowledge advantage retained by grandfathered transmission contract holders 
More information would help the market to self-police

67
Generation and Load Information That Should be Available
"After the fact" actual meter information depicting actual unit-by-unit production and consumption within each zone.
Unit outage information showing planned and forced outages.
Water levels, or hydro outputs.  Weekly/monthly information.
Data on significant unit outages etc. in the peak prices hours in question.
Calls by the ISO on plants with Reliability Must Run contracts.

68
Energy and Ancillary Service Price Information That Should be Available
All bid information in both Day Ahead and Hour Ahead Markets, including generation and load, energy and ancillary services  
The information for these markets should include: initial preferred schedules, final schedules and the BEEP stack, all day ahead load and generation bids  by Scheduling Coordinator

69
Transmission Information That Should be Available
The information should include adjustment bids, day ahead schedules, hour ahead schedules, real time adjustments, actual flows, and transmission availability by category of ownership  
This information should be provided for all transmission lines
Significant Intra-zonal congestion by  transmission path
Data should be differentiated by existing and new, firm use transmission contracts

70
When Should This Information Be Available?
The information listed above ought to be provided as close to "real time" as possible.  
At a minimum it ought to be provided to the market within 24 hours.
