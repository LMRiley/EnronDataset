Jeff,
 Tim told me to put together a list of inormation we would want from the ISO. 
As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the 
highlights:

1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see 
the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the 
following paths:
 a. path 15
 b. path 26
 c. nw1
 d. nw3
 e. az2
 f. az3
 g. lc1

2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)

3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment 
bid out of the stack

4. Intrazonal Cong
 a. What paths have intra-zonal cong
 b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis

5. BEEP stack

6. All load and generation bids DA by SC

7. Real time production from each plant
