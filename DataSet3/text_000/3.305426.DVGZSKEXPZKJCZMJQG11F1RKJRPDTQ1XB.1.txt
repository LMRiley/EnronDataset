EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fellow Board Members;

The following is an Executive Summary of the attached detailed letter that I am sending urging you to maintain the status quo regarding the upcoming proposal to lower the current price cap. 


Significant underscheduling of load that occurred during the week of June 12th caused operational problems for the ISO.


Price Cap arbitrage between the PX day-ahead cap and the ISO real-time cap creates an incentive for SCE to let thousands of MWs ride into the real-time market.


The cost of a grid-wide outage which results from operational problems caused by underscheduling far outweighs any cost savings by the short term “strategic bidding” of load. 


Yet another piece-meal change in the market will further erode credibility and confidence in the ISO by the market participants and FERC.


No generation has been built with price caps in place and applications at the CEC have not increased appreciably.


True issue here is CTC collection and the effect higher prices have on that effort.  Despite hedging tools to protect themselves against high prices SCE appears to have been caught short.


Under CPUC and FERC approved PX Block Forward participation SCE can hedge 2,200 MWs with an increase on July 1st to 5,200 MWs.


SCE has approximately 5.000 MWs of QF supply that is not subject to market volatility and still owns approximately 6,000 MWs of generation and this cost needs to be netted out of any alleged harm to them.


Many market participants have already hedged their risk for this summer based on the $750 cap.  Changing the cap will render these tools useless.


Lowering price caps will increase likelihood of energy moving out of state at critical times.


Neither PG&E nor SDG&E openly support SCE on this.


The event that provoked this debate was a 100-year weather event in the Bay Area.


Longer term “safety net” cap is warranted

Greg Blue, ISO Governing Board
