Attention IT and Scheduling Personnel
Your participation is requested in the  Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid Market

As previously announced, the ISO has scheduled for the first week of October
1, 2000 the implementation of Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bids.  Prior to this
implementation, a Market Simulation is being scheduled for all Market
Participants in order to provide for simulation on the use of this new
functionality.

Tuesday, September 4, 2000.

The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conference call on Thursday, August 31
from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., to elicit participation and review the scope of this
Market Simulation.  During this conference call, we will also request
participants help in finalizing details of the Market Simulation Plan which
will be distributed to Market Simulation Participants by Friday.

All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this
simulation.
