RESTRUCTURING DIGEST: 
Circuit court rules 
PSC can be sued for 
telecom settlement 
The US Court of Appeals for the 10th 
Circuit found that the Utah PSC can be 
sued in federal court over settlement 
decisions the regulators make in 
telephone interconnection cases, The 
Salt Lake Tribune reported yesterday. 
The case started with a fight 
between MCI and US West over plans 
to light dark fiber. 
The PSC decided MCI could only 
get access to US West’s dark fiber if 
US West could get to MCI’s dark fiber. 
Allegheny strikes accord 
with stakeholders 
Allegheny Energy is hoping to separate 
its generation business and go public, 
CFO Michael Morrell told Reuters. 
Allegheny Power, its Ohio utility, 
reached an agreement with stakeholders 
on opening up for competition. It 
would get stranded costs through a 
competitive transition charge and 
transfer about 325 mw of generating 
capacity to the unregulated generation 
subsidiary by Jan 1 to give that unit 
6,000 mw for open markets. 
Allegheny could collect $3 million 
over five years through a transition 
charge to cover environmental law 
costs and some taxes. 
Residential customers would get a 
5% rate cut on the generation portion of 
their bill starting Jan 1 and frozen for 
five years. Commercial and industrial 
generation rates would be frozen for 
three years.

Gaming Calif ISO 
price caps for 
fun and profit 
Avista Corp went into the spring of 
2000 expecting business as usual but 
those who make the rules -- and those 
who game those rules -- created a 
radically different world for those 
relying on Northwest power markets. 
So says Tom Matthews, Avista 
CEO, and one of the first victims. But 
how is the world now changed? 
First, the BPA took the Grand 
Coulee Dam, the area’s biggest, out of 
generation in May to refill the reservoir. 
Instead of selling power, BPA was 
buying. 
The Centralia plant Avista had 
owned part of, when sold became a 
merchant plant but the power was 
signed up right away creating power 
shortages. 
Matthews’ view is that: 
Some people have learned 
how to game the system 
between the Northwest and 
the California PX markets to 
certain benefits depending 
on their position. That 
gaming was not allowed until 
you might say this year in 
the changes of the PX price 
cap rules and some of the 
transmission rules. 
Add to that commercial decisions in 
Canada to send gas east as new 
capacity opens which impacts pricing 
of gas for power generation in the 
West, he noted. 
Add too the changed availability of 
power under BPA’s new subscription 
agreements. 
But then the market was 
complicated by the impact of southern 
California prices being transported 
instantly several thousand miles to the 
Northwest in the second week of May, 
Matthews related. 
“So if we’re going to be forced by 
the state to remain an integrated electric 
utility, the only way we can do that is to 
be power long on an actual basis,” 
Matthews observed in a call with 
security analysts. 
Matthews was asked about the 
outlook for next year. That depends, he 
AT&T wins right to 
keep competitors 
off broadband 
Portland, Ore, cannot make cable 
companies open their networks to 
competing ISPs as a condition for 
getting a local cable franchise, the US 
Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 
yesterday. 
“This is a struggle for control over 
access to cable broadband technology,” 
wrote Judge Sidney Thomas. 
The City of Portland and 
Multnomah County had required merger 
partners AT&T and TCI give nondiscriminatory 
access to their cable 
model platform and AT&T refused. 
The court found that cable 
regulations are not fit to govern twoway, 
internet communications because 
“the transmission of internet service to 
subscribers over cable broadband 
facilities is a telecommunications service 
under the Communications Act. 
“Applying the carefully tailored 
scheme of cable television regulation to 
cable broadband internet access would 
lead to absurd results, inconsistent with 
the statutory structure,” Thomas wrote. 
AT&T plans to introduce internet 
services in Portland very soon. 
The ruling “clarifies decisively the 
limits of local authority when it comes 
to the provision of high-speed internet 
access over cable,” said Jim Cicconi, 
AT&T’s general counsel. 
Another view was this one from 
Jamie Wimberly, vice president of the 
Consumer Energy Council of America. 
“With the Portland decision, AT&T 
won some time. That’s it. The larger 
question is when — not if — broadband 
services over cable will be treated like a 
telecommunications service.” 
He sees a parallel to Bell Atlantic’s 
treatment when supplying the same 
service but over a different platform. 
“AT&T would do itself a great service 
by putting in writing its own open 
access policy before being forced to do 
so.”

cost $100 to $150 next year. 
“In June historical prices have 
averaged $20. They’ll probably be 
about $118 this year. Will they be that 
high next year? 
“I don’t know. If it is -- that’s the 
bogey we have to manage through our 
PCA and rate case.” 
Since 1995, Matthews added, June 
prices have averaged $18-19/mwh. 
Will the state see the situation as a 
fundamental change? 
“Or are we going to have to get into 
a very aggressive litigative mode with 
the state to make sure they understand 
that the market is changing.”

we’ve faced this quarter in terms of 
power prices and impacts on the 
company,” he reported. 
The weather forecasts, stream 
flows and snow pack forecasts have 
turned out to be dead on including 
temperatures so far this year. 
Avista Energy “is likely to be $70 
million of gross margin over and above 
plan” and that will partially offset the hit 
on Avista Corp’s utility side. 
Despite all the negatives (RT, 6/22), 
Avista Corp expects to break even for 
the second quarter including an $8 
million gain on the sale of its share of 
the Centralia generation plant. 
They’re assuming some rate relief 
from the Washington regulators later in 
the year. 
How is it that Avista Energy, the 
unregulated marketing firm, did so well, 
an analyst asked. 
Power marketing positions that 
Avista had with physical or synthetic 
generation supplies in the California 
markets made the difference, Matthews 
replied. 
Avista Energy had became a 
marketing partner with Duke and 
Williams for generation they produced 
in plants bought from incumbent 
California utilities. 
They have “made very attractive 
business out of the California PX.” 
The regulated market is being 
subsidized by the competitive market, 
Matthews observed.                      
What about the outlook for 
being able to manage risk, an analyst 
asked. 
The regulated utility has been long 
on power and made contracts to sell 
and bought some to sell with that 
power. 
Not only did the prices go crazy but 
they had a trader who was told to cover 
a shortage. 
Instead he disobeyed and went 
short by a factor of four more than he 
was supposed to. 
In normal times, his behavior would 
have created a $10 million to $12 million 
problem they could have fairly easily 
resolved. 
What about controls on traders? 
“The floor manager caught the 
trades and said: 
“`Don’t do it. Get out of them and 
cover these other positions,’” Matthews 
related. 
“The trader not only did not get out 
of them, he went the opposite way and 
even doubled up. That was Friday and 
by Monday he was no longer living. 
“The ultimate control is, we will no 
longer do this activity in the utility. 
That business is gone and it’s stopped,” 
Matthews assured. 
“Business has changed. We’re not 
short. We’re not long in power. The 
state’s not going to allow us to 
deregulate. 
“We’re going to be an integrated 
Avista had indexed its 
supply agreements to the 
market price expecting 
normal prices. 
When the above 
prices developed they got 
badly hurt. 
“Next year we’re not 
going to do that,” 
Matthews added. 
“The fundamentals 
of power pricing in this 
part of the country 
have changed forever           
... so much more 
rapidly than we could 
have anticipated or did 
anticipate and now 
we’re going to deal 
with that,” Jon Eliassen, 
Avista Corp CFO told 
security analysts 
yesterday. 
“I’ve been in this 
business for almost 30                                                      
utility. We’re going to be long 
on everything we do,”

Matthews related implying the public

QUOTE OF THE DAY: When 
you take and do a physical 
contract, it locks in the price 
on one side of the deal and lets 
it float with index on the other 
side of the deal and when the 
index runs up to $150 instead 
of $19, all of a sudden you 
have a dumb deal and lose lots 
of money. 
Matthews talking to security 
analysts Wednesday. 
Why didn’t the unregulated marketer 
share information with the utility, an 
analyst asked. 
It’s prohibited by the states, 
Matthews replied. 
Bliley gets kudos 
and more requests 
A large, diverse stakeholders group 
thanked House Commerce Committee 
Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va, for 
working to move forward a 
comprehensive electric restructuring bill 
with a provision to have the 
transmission grid operate under one set 
of open access rules. 
But the stakeholders told Bliley in a 
letter released today by the committee 
his draft does not “provide fully the 
jurisdictional framework for regulation 
of transmission facilities” they consider 
needed. 
The stakeholders include EPSA,     
ELCON, the Consumer Federation of 
America, NEM and a number of IOUs 
and munies. 
A separate letter from Dominion 
Resources, Dynegy, MidAmerican 
Energy, PG&E Corp, TECO Energy, 
UtiliCorp and Wisconsin Electric urged 
Bliley to include repeal of PUHCA and 
the buying provisions of PURPA, 
extension of FERC jurisdiction to all 
grid owners, reliability language and 
affirmation of FERC authority to 
promote RTOs. 
Congress allows 
online signature 
---  
What about NJ wet 
signature rule? 
The digital signature bill passed last 
Friday by Congress could make New 
Jersey’s pending internet sign-up pilot 
available to all consumers there, not the 
cap of 350,000 accounts envisioned by 
the Board of Public Utilities pilot 
program. 
BPU President Herbert Tate is 
reading the law that President Clinton is 
expected to sign. 
Tate wants to see whether it will 
preempt the state regulator’s test plan to 
limit the number of consumers who 
could switch energy providers 
electronically. 
“We’re analyzing that,” Tate said, 
adding that he started reviewing the bill 
Tuesday. 
At issue is whether the pending 
federal law would apply to retail energy 
markets that have traditionally been 
regulated on the state level but are 
expanding with suppliers coming from 
across state lines.                        
“We’re looking at this law to see 
what impact it would have on wholesale 
and retail,” Tate said. 
“The state may not be able to look 
at it on a limited basis.” 
New Jersey’s Energy Competition 
Act required suppliers to get real (called 
wet) signatures from customers before 
switching, a rule marketers complained 
discouraged customers from shopping. 
But the law, Tate reminded, calls 
for eventually implementing an online 
sign-up program for gas and electricity. 
The BPU is to vote in July on 
setting up the pilot shortly after Labor 
Day. 
The agency and a working group of 
utilities and marketers came up with a 
verification process for the internet pilot 
that may be superseded by the federal 
digital signature if it indeed “becomes 
the law of the land and becomes a way 
of business life,” Tate explained. 
The pilot would have marketers 
take customer orders online by getting 
account numbers and other information 
and then telling the incumbent about the 
order. 
The utility is to generate a notice to 
customers informing them they will be 
switched in 14 days unless they protest. 
BPU avoided use of third parties to 
confirm the switch as is done in long 
distance phone service switching, 
deeming the utility notification to be 
“less intrusive,” Tate said. 
The notice process is required with 
the wet signature too. Marketers expect 
the internet sign-up to speed things 
along. 
Marketers with online sign-up 
experience in other states told the BPU it 
is much more expensive for them to 
enroll customers with paperwork. 
Many newcomers to New Jersey, such 
as Utility.com and Greenmountain.com, 
want to use the internet as a primary 
source of sales. 
Utilities’ distribution rate cuts 
coupled with wholesale price volatility 
the past two summers -– anticipated for 
this summer too -– compelled the BPU 
to cut marketers a break. 
The distribution rate cuts are 5% 
for this first year of competition and an 
additional 10% for the next three years 
and then stop. 
“They feel they are working on 
thinner margins,” Tate said. 
“That’s why we’re lowering the cost of 
customer acquisition.” 
The BPU wanted to limit the pilot to 
10% of each utility’s territory so it 
could keep an eye out for problems and 
fix them without it causing widespread 
damage, Tate said. 
The cap is a high ceiling

considering it is three-and-a-half times 
the number of consumers who have 
switched in the six months that choice 
has existed, Tate noted. 
Electricity shopping officially 
started in November and gas markets 
officially opened in January. 
The BPU wants to make sure 
consumers are protected from 
slamming, Tate added, noting even with 
wet signatures some customers claim 
they were switched unwittingly. 
A recent survey by BPU of 
consumers found that two-thirds favor 
the wet signature process while the 
remaining third want an alternative. 
“We’re not against it. We’re 
certainly in favor of use of the internet. 
We wanted to have some time to look at 
it. We weren’t going to take a long time 
to do that,” Tate said. 
The working group met with the 
BPU Tuesday to go over the pilot’s 
rules before Tate and the two other 
commissioners vote on it. 
Tate wanted to make sure they 
were “comfortable with it” before going 
ahead, he said. “That’s kind of how 
we’ve been doing business since we 
embarked on deregulation,” he added. 
BPU’s $13 million/year consumer 
education program is to add TV and 
radio announcements to publicize the 
non-wet signature pilot. 
(With this story RT changes the 
spelling of Internet to internet 
because a recent search of the 
web suggests that the internet is 
no longer treated as a proper 
name).

Clinton seeks action 
on power markets bill 
President Bill Clinton urged Congress’ 
leaders yesterday to take on his energy 
proposals that have languished, 
including the administration’s 
Comprehensive Electricity Restructuring 
Act. 
He listed favored measures to 
include a $4 billion package of tax 
incentives to spur consumers to buy 
more energy efficient homes, cars and 
consumer products, $1.4 billion in the 
fiscal year 2001 budget for DOE 
investments in energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, gas and distributed 
generation systems, reauthorization of 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the 
establishment of a home heating oil 
reserve for the Northeast and 
replenishment of low income energy aid 
funds. 
“I urge you to work closely with 
me to enact these critical energy 
proposals without further delay,” 
Clinton wrote. 
DOE Secretary Bill Richardson 
expressed disappointment with the 
Senate Energy & Natural Resources 
Committee’s failure to move forward a 
comprehensive electric deregulation bill. 
The reliability-only bill has few teeth 
by itself to address transmission 
congestion, the imbalance of generation 
and transmission capacity with rising 
demand, “spotty” development of open 
markets and decreased utility spending 
on energy efficiency programs, 
Richardson said. 
“While the imposition of mandatory 
rules governing the conduct of utilities’ 
operation of the bulk power system is 
needed, it will do little, if anything, to 
address the problems that have put us in 
this bind,” he complained. 
“I hope that the Senate Energy &                      
Natural Resources Committee will 
reconsider and adopt comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation. 
“Nothing less than the reliability of 
our electric grid is at stake,” he added. 
Richardson’s relations with Capitol 
Hill are tenuous as Republicans blame 
the administration for skyrocketing 
gasoline prices and members of the 
Senate Armed Services and Intelligence 
committees have assailed Richardson 
over security lapses at the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory. 
The increasing tension was 
exacerbated when Richardson did not 
go to a hearing on the Los Alamos issue 
last week. He took hits from senators 
at a hearing Wednesday who 
complained the Secretary had not done   
enough to improve security at the lab 
since the Wen Ho Lee scandal. 
“You’ve had a bright and brilliant 
career. But you will never again receive 
the support of the Senate of the United 
States for any office to which you 
might be appointed. It’s gone. You’ve 
squandered your treasure,” said Sen 
Robert Byrd, D-WVa, a 41-year veteran 
of the Senate. 
“You’ve lost all credibility,” Sen 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala, told Richardson. 
Richardson responded that he has 
done more in the last two years to 
improve security than had been done in 
20 years. 
“It’s unacceptable, 
incomprehensible to me what happened. 
I will not rest until I know what 
happened, when, where, why and by 
whom,” he said. 
Court Upholds EPA on Nox 
The EPA’s clean air plan for the Eastern 
US was upheld today by the US Court 
of Appeals for District of Columbia 
Circuit that rejected protests by some 
power companies in the Midwest and 
Southeast. 
The decision stems from the 1998 
EPA rule mandating a cut in NOx 
emissions from 22 states believed to be 
causing pollution in downwind states. 
The court ruled states must submit 
plans to EPA within four months on 
how they plan to cleanup coal-fired 
plants.
