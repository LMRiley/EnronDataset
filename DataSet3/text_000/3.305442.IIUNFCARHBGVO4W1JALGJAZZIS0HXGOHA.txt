As you may have noticed, there was a network error during today's eSpeak with 
Dr. Ben Gilad.  Although the questions and answers were not visible during 
the second half of the eSpeak session, Dr. Gilad did answer all the questions 
he received.  As always, the transcript of the discussion will be available 
in the eSpeak archives.  

If the technical issue prevented you from asking a question during today's 
session, please email your question to Amy Oberg at Enron Energy Services.  
Dr. Gilad has generously offered to respond to questions that could not be 
submitted during the live event.
