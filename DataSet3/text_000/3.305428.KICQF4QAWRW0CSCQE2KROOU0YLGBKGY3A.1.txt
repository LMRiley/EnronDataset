Subj: Pre-arranged trades on the CAPX Block Forward Market


Today I witnessed what seemed to be clear pre-arranged trades on the CAPX Block Forward Market. I keep a close eye on the Block Forward Market. I therefore immediately see when bids or offers are put out in the market. I transact in the Block Forward Market regularly, so I have a keen interest in what the market is. 
Today, 23 June 2000, there were four trades that occurred the instant they were put onto the Block Forward screen. The products that were traded were Q1 SP15 at $47 for 75 mw; Q2 SP15 at $53.25 for 75 mw; Q3 SP15 at $102 for 75 mw; and Q4 SP15 at $41 for 75 mw. The time of each transaction was 0653. I spoke with Duke Durose at the CAPX after I saw these transactions appear on the block forward screen. He stated that he was on the phone with the offer, and as soon as he put it onto the block forward screen, it was immediately lifted (purchased). 
On most days, a bid or offer will sit there the entire time the market is open, and nothing will trade. In fact, many times there are not even two sides of the market. It would not be a stretch to say that when a transaction does occur, the bid or offer has been there for an hour or more. 
This situation is extremely suspicious and we at Enron are very upset at what I consider to be pre-arranged trades between two counterparties through the CAPX block forward market. I demand that this situation be investigated immediately, and if pre-arranged trades are occurring, they must be halted.
