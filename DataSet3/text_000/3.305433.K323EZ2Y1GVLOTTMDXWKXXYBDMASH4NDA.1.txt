West Power Trading

Bob Badeer  Accomplishments     6/15/00



 7.5  mm P/L
Aggressively used EOL. Consistently have been putting tight markets out on EOL. Have established EOL as the one thing that the market looks at to find out California markets. (Do not know what my current volumes have been)
Kept the southwest together in the midst of many changes. Worked all the trading on STSW by myself for over 1 month. 
Created a much greater flow of information to and from the gas desk. This information was critical to me in the southwest and California. I believe I communicated the information quickly to all other traders on our desk.
Helped the fundies group get started on gathering and analyzing information on gas. There is still much to do in this area, but I feel we have made progress.
Starting to get my fingers dirty on the regulatory issues in California. (10 minute settlements and CONG management) 
Only 17 deal entry errors since Jan 1.
