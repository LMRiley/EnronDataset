Craig Rose's article includes the price we offered to SDG&E -- thanks to 
Peace.  He makes us look like the bad guys in some respects -- at least he's 
saying let's try to make the market work first -- before asking the CPUC for 
price caps.

S.D. urged to make best of a bad electric deal Long-term contract would lock in prices



By Craig D Rose
STAFF WRITER

July 8,2000


The proponents of electrical deregulation in California--who promised that open markets would bring an array of consumer choices and lower prices--are now encouraging San Diego to contract for years with a single power provider at prices likely far higher than they were as recently as May

The calls to lock in prices with a major power company come as politicians,consumer advocates and SDG&E scramble for ways to bring stability to the local power market,where electricity costs have tripled in recent weeks and show no sign of leveling off

A long-term contract with a single provider at a fixed price is being touted as a market solution to San Diego's power problem

San Diego Gas&Electric Co,which passes along the price it pays for power to consumers in San Diego County,says it is in discussion with several companies The local utility declined to discuss details,but state Sen Steve Peace,D-El Cajon,said one offer has come from Enron Corp,a representative of which was among the leaders of a coalition that defeated tighter state power price controls earlier this week

Houston-based Enron,the nation's biggest power marketer,is offering to sell San Diego power for four years at 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour,according to Peace The price would be about 50 percent less than current costs,but more than 50 percent above rates paid as recently as this spring

Under California's deregulation plan,San Diegans became the first in the state to pay market prices for power Other major urban areas will continue to pay regulated rates for at least one year

But San Diego has paid a steep price for its precedent:Typical power bills have risen from about 55 last year at this time to 90,with higher costs expected as the summer heats up Peace,the key architect of California's deregulation,said the Enron offer was encouraging

The good news is that there is an offer on the table that would contain the bleeding,Peace said But he quickly added that Enron's offer would be the first among many from other power companies

We can find out in a few days if the market can respond,Peace said If they don't,the California Public Utilities Commission must put a rate freeze into effect

Peace said attempts to bring a competitive electricity market to California have been stymied by power companies,who are exploiting the embryonic market for their own advantage

These guys are hiding behind the mantra of competition to profiteer There is no doubt about it,he said

If the profiteering can't be stopped,it will lead to re-regulation of the power industry in California and the rest of the nation,Peace said

SDG&E would need approval from the Public Utilities Commission to enter into a long-term,fixed-price power contract The PUC rejected such a request last year,but that was before the big run-up in power prices

Long-term contracts represent a gamble on future prices:if market prices rise about the fixed price,the bet is won If prices fell below the contract,the bet would in effect cost the region money

It's a wager that industry analysts say Enron may be better positioned to make than San Diego

What would happen is that you would pay a lower rate than the free market in summer but a higher rate in the winter,said Michael Heim,a power industry analyst who follows Enron for A.G. Edwards

Enron is pretty smart They don't put out those bets unless they believe it will be good for them and bad for the customers

Added David Fleischer,a managing director of research at Goldman Sachs:Enron takes less risk than anyone I know

A prominent state consumer advocate also criticized the prospect of a long-term power deal at this time

This is no better than a boiler fraud on the people,said Harvey Rosenfield,who unsuccessfully pressed a ballot initiative to overturn deregulation They jack up rates over 200 percent--then they offer you a deal at a 50 percent hike

I don't think the solution to this problem is to put the people of San Diego at the mercy of Enron

SDG&E,meanwhile,said it will hold a emergency meeting of energy market players in San Diego on Wednesday to explore methods of reining in high power prices

Clearly,there are problems in the marketplace that need to be addressed--and addressed now,said Edwin Guiles,president of SDG&E

The San Diego utility company also said it will seed a new fund to assist low-income customers with their power bills SDG&E said it will provide 1 in corporate funding for every 4 other companies contribute,with a minimum 100,000 commitment from SDG&E

The fund would supplement other programs,along with the utility's level-payment plan,which allows customers to average power costs over a yearly cycle

Mayor Susan Golding yesterday scheduled a July 20 public hearing on electricity prices The hearing is set for 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in Kearny Mesa at the Ridgehaven Court Environmental Services Building,9601 Ridgehaven Court

The mayor's main concern is to find out the reasons why the public is paying an exorbitant cost of more money in their electricity bills,said Ric Grenell,Golding's press secretary

It's inexcusable that they've spiked over the last couple of months,he said

Among those who have agreed to participate in the hearing are California Energy Commission Chairman William Keese,Commissioner Art Rosenfeld and representatives of SDG&E,the Regional Energy Office and the U.S. Department of Energy,Grenell said

At the state level,Peace said that by the end of the month he will submit a proposal to provide Gov Gray Davis with emergency powers to build power plants and transmission line in the state Peace said the emergency authority is needed to expedite the projects and address the state's power shortfall

The governor indicated to me he'd like to have a proposal before July 24th,Peace said,insisting the emergency powers would help protect the environment by coordinating project development

But consumer advocates said such emergency powers could override environmental protection and local review of power plant siting

Now that we're at the mercy of the greed of the utility industry,their response is that we need to strip away the rest of consumer and environmental protections,Rosenfield said

We must cram this genie back into the bottle We have to get back to regulating this industry

Heat leaves state feeling lack of energy

POWER:California regulators might lower price caps that have already been put in place

O.C. companies are savvy about power

The Orange County Register



A heat wave is expected to hit California in the coming week,prompting worried state officials to search for ways to reduce demand for electricity

California suffered three days of strained power supplies last week,when warm weather pushed demand higher Utilities asked businesses to cut power,a worrisome sign that a widespread blackout might hit the state sometime this year

At an emergency meeting Thursday,the California Independent System Operator,an agency that manages most of the electricity in the state,considered steps to keep energy prices in check,including putting a second price cap in two weeks on wholesale electricity

The scramble for electricity is exacerbated by a growing population,a thriving economy and an uneasy transition to an open market

The agency is struggling to protect consumers while still giving the companies that sell electricity an incentive to sell in California Electricity bills have risen nearly 60 percent since May for thousands of consumers in San Diego and south Orange counties,where San Diego Gas&Electric Co,which serves that area,passed on higher electricity costs to residents and businesses

The state's other large utilities-Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric-cannot raise electricity prices for residential and small-business customers because their rates are frozen

The California ISO is considering lowering the price cap on electricity from 500 per megawatt hour to 250 per megawatt hour That comes a week after the board reduced a 750 cap to 500 and decided to investigate rising costs

The agency is worried,however,that the cap could discourage power-plant developers from building new generators in California It also could motivate generators to sell power in other Western states where caps don't exist and prices are higher

Here's what you need to know about the electricity supply and how it affects Orange County consumers

Q How did this start

A Demand has surged because about 600,000 new residents enter the state every year,but no power plants have been built in a decade

Most of the growth has occurred inland,where temperatures rise dramatically in the summer and residents rely heavily on air conditioning

The addition of new jobs,particularly in technology and manufacturing,also requires more electricity Computers are using a bigger chunk of the power supply,gobbling up an estimated 13 percent of available power sources last year,up from just 1 percent in 1983

Q How do price caps affect me

A If you're a residential or small-business customer of Southern California Edison,it won't affect you at all Customers of that utility are protected by a rate cap imposed as part of deregulation Rates were frozen at artificially high levels to allow utilities to collect money to pay debt and recoup lost revenue for unprofitable assets,such as nuclear power plants The cap stays until 2002 or until the utility pays off these stranded costs

San Diego Gas&Electric,which serves 100,000 customers in Dana Point,San Juan Capistrano,San Clemente and parts of Laguna Beach,Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo,paid off its stranded costs in June 1999

Q If I buy my electricity from San Diego Gas&Electric,how much more will I pay

A Higher market rates mean the average SDG&E residential customer now will pay 87.50 per month,or 10.7 cents per kilowatt,vs 55,or 3.3 cents per kilowatt,in May

Customers pay an amount that blends the higher rates charged on peak days with the lower fees charged when the weather cools and electricity is less in demand

Q What efforts can consumers take to reduce electricity

A Blackouts typically occur early in the week,often on a Monday That's because businesses are turning on air conditioners,often after peak usage on a hot summer weekend

Consumers should avoid using dryers or washing machines from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.-peak hours for energy use

Turning air conditioners off when leaving the house,using fans and setting thermostats a few degrees higher,to 78 or 80 degrees,will help save energy

Residents should draw blinds and drapes during the day to keep out the sun If possible,try to reduce trips to the refrigerator and freezer

Demand for Electricity Tests Power-Grid Operator
Deregulation:Acting as a traffic cop on the electron freeway,young agency faces tough task amid shortages


By NANCY VOGEL,Times Staff Writer






     FOLSOM,Calif--Electricity first flowed from a water-driven powerhouse in this city in 1895,running 22 miles down a single wire to move streetcars and light the Capitol in downtown Sacramento
     Today the electrical cord for California's trillion-dollar economy runs through here,though it's tougher to find than a wire strung across oak-studded foothills In an unremarkable office building in this city are the banks of computers and 408 employees who control California's electron freeway They call themselves the California Independent System Operator,or Cal-ISO
     Every four seconds this nonprofit,2-year-old creation of the Legislature balances California's consumption of electricity against the energy poured into three-quarters of California from power plants here and across the West
     This summer,for reasons far more profound than hot weather,that's a nerve-jangling job,and the system operator has shot out of obscurity lately with news of rolling brownouts,a barge-based power plant on San Francisco Bay,soaring electric bills in San Diego and price caps in what is supposed to be an unfettered market for electricity
     The management and staff at the ISO have been put under incredible stress over the last several weeks,trying to keep the lights on,said Jan Smutny-Jones,head of the board governing the system operator
     Rarely has California's wiring been more volatile or valuable
     It is two years since deregulation of the state's 28-billion electrical industry was launched and a decade since the construction of significant new sources of energy Electricity consumption is rising at the pace of about two major power plants per year and a computer-based economy is more dependent than ever,not just on electricity but on electricity that flows without surge or sag Suddenly it seems the seventh-largest economy in the world cannot take power for granted
     The system is severely,severely stressed,said Daniel Nix,a deputy director of the California Energy Commission We're in a transition period
     Valley of despair is what S David Freeman,general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,calls it Before he took over the DWP,Freeman helped establish Cal-ISO,and he credits its staff with doing an excellent job
     They've got a new system that hasn't got its britches on and the old system has been abandoned,said Freeman They're relying on a marketplace that's about as volatile as a Mexican jumping bean
     As gatekeeper of the power grid,the system operator is supposed to act like an air traffic controller Its job is to regulate the flow of electricity on the high-voltage transmission lines built and once controlled by Southern California Edison,Pacific Gas&Electric Co and other private utilities
     When lawmakers voted in 1996 to open California's electrical market to competition,they figured those utilities would enrich themselves and stifle competition if they controlled the power lines Better to have a nonprofit guardian,lawmakers figured
     But air traffic controllers aren't supposed to set the price of airplane seats,and that's the unenviable position of Cal-ISO lately,said Smutny-Jones

     Imposing Price Cap
     When a heat wave hits and private utilities have failed to order enough electricity a day ahead to satisfy their customers air conditioners and computers,it's up to Cal-ISO to find the electricity to fill the gap and keep the transmission lines humming
     We've had several days in the last several weeks where the ISO has had to go out and find,say,12,000 megawatts of power in a few hours,and when you do that you pay through the nose,said Smutny-Jones After the system operator was forced to pay the record price of $9,999 per megawatt July 13,1998,its board of governors imposed a price cap that now stands at 500 per megawatt For comparison,the city of Los Angeles was consuming 4,248 megawatts of electricity at 3:26 p.m. Friday,according to DWP
     Among those pushing to lower the price cap to 250 per megawatt--to be considered by the 26-member board of governors today--is state Sen Steve Peace D-El Cajon,a chief architect of the 1996 deregulation law Unlike most Californians,his constituents are not buffered from soaring electricity costs That's because San Diego Gas&Electric is the first utility under the 1996 restructuring law to finish selling off its assets and thus free itself from a Legislature-imposed freeze on rates
     In the last 45 days the electricity portion of homeowners monthly bills in San Diego has increased by 47,or 240,on the average
     This is just the beginning,said Michael Shames,executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego This is obscene
     For the rest of California,said Shames,San Diego consumers are the ghost of summer future
     In this new electricity world,what hurts San Diego consumers has helped Los Angeles,whose citizen-owned utility is in the either smart or lucky position of having enough electricity from its hydropower,gas and coal-fired plants to sell to Cal-ISO,Freeman said
     We're making a terrific profit,he said,selling for 75 cents a kilowatt-hour electricity that costs 7 or 8 cents to generate at most The profit--as much as 5 million on the hottest days--is being used to shrink the department's debt
     Still,Freeman said he would support a lower price cap
     They shouldn't have started the era of competition until there were enough power plants and transmission lines to be sure you had an adequate supply,he said
     Energy experts say there would be more power to sell in California if rapidly growing cities such as Phoenix and Las Vegas weren't sucking up what had been surplus power on the electrical grid that covers the West,from British Columbia to Baja California
     A hiatus of roughly a decade in the construction of major power plants in California doesn't help,either Nervousness about deregulation dissuaded private energy producers from investing in California until recently The state has approved construction of five new plants since 1996,with 14 more in the works,said Nix,but it will be several years before those new generators pump electrons into the grid
     Even that won't be enough to guarantee reliability Places such as San Francisco,the Silicon Valley and San Diego suffer from inadequate transmission capacity,experts say,so even if power plants are generating enough electricity to meet demand,it can't reach customers On June 14,that's what happened in the San Francisco Bay Area,when Cal-ISO ordered the Pacific Gas&Electric Co to cut off power to 97,000 customers for as long as 90 minutes
     On June 30,Cal-ISO staff proposed installing a floating power plant on a barge in San Francisco Bay to help meet demand in that region,which shot up 10 between June 1999 and June 2000
     Such a plant probably couldn't obtain permits and start operating until next summer,if at all,say Cal-ISO board members In the meantime,some businesses are taking care of themselves
     Bob Hepple,president of c Power,a four-month-old company that builds small,on-site power generators for data centers,telecommunication companies and other firms,said business is explosive
     We have rolling brownouts in the high-tech capital of the world,he said They'll pay millions to make sure their power doesn't ever go out They're starting to realize the fragile nature of the grid
     

     Power Up
     California's electrical system is most stressed on hot summer days when peak demand--the total draw on the electrical grid at any instant--soars The chart below shows how that peak demand has increased since 1990 It is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.7 over the next decade
     POWER FACTS
     California's electrical grid offers 99.9 reliability,meaning that a customer can expect about eight hours of power interruption each year High-tech industry officials say they need six 9 reliability--reliability of 99.9999,or possible interruptions of eight seconds each year
     On average,California imports from other states 25 of the electricity it consumes
     So far this summer,the California Independent System Operator,which controls the electrical grid spanning three-quarters of California,has declared four Stage 2 alerts in which power reserves are so low that large commercial customers are asked to voluntarily cut back power consumption Four such emergencies were declared in 1998,and one was declared last summer
     Air-conditioning accounts for 28 of California's peak demand for electricity,with half of that demand in homes and half in commercial and industrial buildings
