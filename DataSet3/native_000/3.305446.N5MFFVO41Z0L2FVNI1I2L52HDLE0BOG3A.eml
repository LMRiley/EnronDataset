FYI,
It has been a valiant effort but as soon as we free up space on the Notes 
server it fills back in. 
So as a result we will be shutting down the notes server tonight from 8:00 PM 
until 12:00 AM to rebuild the data drives. This will provide more space to 
work with and allow for room to grow.
We will also be turning on a purge agent in 2 weeks that will eliminate mail 
from your Inbox, Sent Mail and Trash after it reaches 30 days of age.
Please shut down Lotus Notes before you leave to night to help ensure we do 
not lose any data.

Thanks,
Mike Mc.
