Brian, 

Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.   I think he has a good 
idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.  Currently, it is done on 
an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.  

Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?  It would 
be an excellent start.

Thanks.

Michelle
