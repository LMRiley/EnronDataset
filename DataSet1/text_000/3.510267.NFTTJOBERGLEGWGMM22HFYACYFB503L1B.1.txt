 CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS AGREEMENT

This Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (“the  Agreement”) is signed by me, _________________________________, as a condition and in consideration of my employment by Enron Corp., or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates (“Enron”).
Witnesseth:

Whereas, Enron’s success depends upon maintaining strict secrecy with respect to Enron’s trade secrets and other confidential information, and I have acquired, had access to, or may acquire or have access to Enron’s Confidential Information during the course of my employment; and

Whereas, I agree not to make any unauthorized disclosures of Enron’s Confidential Information.

Now, Therefore, in consideration of such employment or the continuation of same, and of the salary or wages paid me in the course of such employment, and the confidential information provided to me, Enron and I do agree as follows:

1.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; NON-DISCLOSURE:  I acknowledge that the business of Enron is highly competitive and that Enron has provided and will provide me with access to Confidential Information relating to the business of Enron.  “Confidential Information” means and includes Enron’s confidential and/or proprietary information and/or trade secrets that have been developed or used and/or will be developed and that cannot be obtained readily by third parties from outside sources.  Confidential Information includes, by way of example and without limitation, the following: information regarding customers, employees, contractors, and the industry not generally known to the public; strategies, methods, books, records, and documents; technical information concerning products, equipment, services, and processes; procurement procedures and pricing techniques; the names of and other information concerning customers, investors, and business affiliates (such as contact name, service provided, pricing for that customer, type and amount of services used, credit and financial data, and/or other information relating to Enron’s relationship with that customer); pricing strategies and price curves; positions; plans and strategies for expansion or acquisitions; budgets; customer lists; research; communications and electronic commerce information; weather data; financial and sales data; trading methodologies and terms; evaluations, opinions, and interpretations of information and data; marketing and merchandising techniques; prospective customers’ names and marks; grids and maps; electronic databases; models; specifications; computer programs; internal business records; contracts benefiting or obligating Enron; bids or proposals submitted to any third party; technologies and methods; training methods and training processes; organizational structure; personnel information including salaries; performance, etc.; payment amounts or rates paid to consultants or other service providers; and other such confidential or proprietary information.  I acknowledge that this Confidential Information constitutes a valuable, special, and unique asset used by Enron in its business to obtain a competitive advantage over its competitors.  I further acknowledge that protection of such Confidential Information against unauthorized disclosure and use is of critical importance to Enron in maintaining its competitive position.  I also will have access to, or knowledge of, Confidential Information of third parties, such as actual and potential customers, suppliers, partners, joint venturers, investors, financing sources and the like, of Enron. 

I agree and promise that I will not, at any time during or after my employment with Enron, make any unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information of Enron, or make any use thereof, except in the carrying out of my employment responsibilities hereunder. I also agree to preserve and protect the confidentiality of third party Confidential Information to the same extent, and on the same basis, as Enron’s Confidential Information.

2.  INVENTIONS; ASSIGNMENT:  “Inventions” means discoveries, creations, developments, technical information, trade secrets, concepts and ideas, whether copyrightable or patentable or not, including but not limited to, products, computer programs, charts, databases, processes, methods, formulas, and techniques, as well as improvements, manuals and documentation thereof or know-how related thereto, relating to any present or prospective activities of Enron, or any organization with which it is affiliated, with which activities I am acquainted as a result or consequence of my employment by Enron.

I agree to disclose promptly and fully to Enron all Inventions that I make or conceive, whether or not during my hours of employment or with the use of Enron facilities, materials, or personnel, and I assign without further compensation to Enron all my rights to such Inventions and to any patents granted upon such Inventions.  In addition, I agree that Enron shall have the royalty-free right to use in its business, and to use, make, and sell products, processes, and/or services derived from any inventions, discoveries, concepts, and ideas, whether or not copyrightable or patentable, including but not limited to products, processes, methods, formulas, and techniques, as well as improvements thereof or know-how related thereto, which are not within the scope of Inventions as hereinabove defined but which are conceived or made by me during the hours which I am employed by Enron or with the use or assistance of Enron facilities, materials, or personnel.

3.  PROTECTION OF BUSINESS INTERESTS:  I agree not to disclose or use during my employment by Enron any trade secrets or proprietary information not freely available to the public which is the property of any of my former employers.  Further, I agree that during my employment by Enron, I will undertake no planning for or organization of or participation in any business activity competitive with the work I perform or with the profit unit I work for as an employee of Enron, and that I will not combine or conspire with other employees of Enron for the purpose of planning for or organization of or participation in any such business activity.  The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives or assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Enron, its successors and assigns, it being understood that Enron may assign this Agreement, either in its entirety or severally, from time to time.  

4.  NON-SOLICITATION:  During my employment and for twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment for any reason, I will not call on, service, or solicit competing business from customers of Enron, or its affiliates whom I, within the previous twenty-four (24) months (or the length of my employment with Enron, whichever is less), (i) had or made contact with, or (ii) had access to information and files about.  Likewise, during my employment, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment for any reason, I will not, either directly or indirectly, call on, solicit, or induce any other employee or officer of Enron, or its affiliates whom I had contact with, knowledge of, or association with in the course of my employment with Enron to terminate his or her employment, and will not assist any other person or entity in such a solicitation, without the express written consent of Enron.  

5.  EMPLOYMENT IS AT WILL:  I understand and agree that my employment and compensation is at-will and can be terminated at any time, with or without notice by me and/or Enron.  I further agree that this Agreement is not a contract for employment for a specified period of time.  I understand that no officer, manager, or representative of Enron has the authority to enter into any oral or written agreement or to make any agreement contrary to the foregoing unless approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors of Enron, in which case such an agreement will modify this at-will provision.

6.  STATEMENTS ABOUT ENRON: I shall refrain, both during and after my employment, from publishing any oral or written statements about Enron or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of such entities' officers, employees, agents, or representatives that are disparaging, slanderous, libelous, or defamatory; or that disclose private or confidential information about their business affairs; or that constitute an intrusion into their seclusion or private lives; or that give rise to unreasonable publicity about their private lives; or that place them in a false light before the public; or that constitute a misappropriation of their name or likeness.

7.  CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS TO ENRON:  This Agreement shall not terminate by reason of the termination of my employment; nor may it be modified, released, or abandoned, except by written instrument properly executed by both Enron and myself.

In Witness Whereof, I have signed this Agreement on _______________________ [date].
