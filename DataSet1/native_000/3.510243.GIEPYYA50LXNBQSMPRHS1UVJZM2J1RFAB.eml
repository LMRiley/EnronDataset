Hoyt,

Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic 
information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages 
in exchange for a release.  We need the title/position and the age of the 
persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as 
well as the persons who were not offered a package.  We will provide this 
data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.

Thanks.

Michelle
